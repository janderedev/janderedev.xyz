I finally took the time to give this website it's long needed rewrite.
<!--more-->
I finished the previous version of this site just a couple months ago. However, I made a mistake: I created it using React (and Vite).
This meant that not only was it too complicated to maintain - It was also needlessly bloated and dependant on JavaScript.
You can view that site [here](https://janderedev-xyz-old.vercel.app) if you wish.

This new version was made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), and the source code is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/janderedev/janderedev.xyz).
It finally features a proper blog and works without JavaScript. I tried to make it compatible with terminal browsers as well, but gave up on that after a while.

Huge thanks to [FatalErrorCoded](https://fatalerrorcoded.eu) for letting me "reuse" his code as well as providing me with a Plausible instance.

I didn't do any special styling for these yet, so most of them use the default html styling. This part is definitely not finished yet.
